## [35] CodeExplained.md (2,500+ Lines)
**What is it?** Explains EVERY line of code in simple terms

**Why you need it:** Because I wasn't explaining the code before!

**What's inside:** For every code example in Document 1:
- What does this line do?
- Why is it needed?
- What happens when it runs?
- Real examples of input and output

**Example:**
```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
```

**My old explanation:** "Get the Agent tool"

**New explanation:** 
- `from` = Take something
- `google.adk.agents` = From Google's AI agent library
- `import` = Load it into your program
- `Agent` = The specific tool we need
- **Real world comparison**: It's like going to a toolbox and getting a hammer before you build a house

**How to use it:** When you see code, look it up here to understand what each line does.
